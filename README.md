# Proportional font for micro:bit

This is a set proportional font for the micro:bit.
The font is more condensed than the system font,
because most characters are less than 5 pixels wide.

Here are the features of this package:
- Narrower text, i.e. more efficient use of the LED display.
- The "interval" of the show number/string blocks are settable.
- A show space block, that scrolls a specified number of blank columns.
- Text/number is always scrolled regardless of its length.

**
This package is still work in progress (see the TODO list).
However, the API is already complete, and there is no forseeable changes.
